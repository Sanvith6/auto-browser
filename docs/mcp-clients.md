# MCP Client Integration

Auto Browser exposes a real MCP transport at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

It also exposes convenience endpoints at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools/call
```

## Transport model

Auto Browser is currently an **HTTP MCP server**.

That means:
- MCP clients with HTTP transport support can talk to it directly
- clients that only support stdio can use a small local bridge in front of it

## Why this matters

Most browser automation projects are just scripts or raw APIs.

Auto Browser is interesting because it already packages the browser layer as an MCP-native tool server with:
- session lifecycle
- observations
- tool calls
- approvals
- auth profile reuse
- human takeover

## Recommended local setup

1. start Auto Browser locally
2. confirm `make doctor` passes
3. point your MCP-capable client at `/mcp`
4. use the browser tools for:
   - session create
   - observe
   - actions
   - auth profile save/reuse

## If your client only supports stdio

Use a thin local bridge/proxy that converts stdio-style MCP into HTTP calls to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

Auto Browser stays the MCP server of record. The bridge is just compatibility glue.

## Recommended first demo

The best MCP demo is:

1. create session
2. navigate/login manually once if needed
3. save auth profile
4. open a second session from that auth profile
5. continue work through MCP tools

That shows why MCP + browser state reuse is more valuable than a plain “open page and click things” demo.

## Raw tool-call example

If you want to see the shape of the tool surface without wiring up a full MCP client yet:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools | jq

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools/call \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "browser.create_session",
    "arguments": {
      "name": "demo",
      "start_url": "https://example.com"
    }
  }' | jq
```
